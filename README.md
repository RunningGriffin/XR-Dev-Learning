I am learning how to work on XR development in the Unity Application. This is an introduction to my learning progression. 

I decided to work on this project to broaden my comfortability on working in other software spaces.

# Development Environment

I used the tools of Unity in this Project so far.

I used the XR Interaction Toolkit and XR Plugin Management Libraries in Unity.
